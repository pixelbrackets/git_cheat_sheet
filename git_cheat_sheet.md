# Git Cheat Sheet

* Legend: `<>` required, `[]` optional

## Create & Clone

* Clone an existing repository

		git clone ~/git/some_local_repo.git
		git clone git@example.com:repo.git

	_default protocoll is ssh_

* Create a new local repository

		mkdir repo && cd repo
		git init

* Import existing local repository to remote

		git remote add origin ssh://git@example.com/repo.git
		git push -u origin master

	_`-u` ≙ push for first time and set upstream_

* Create remote repository for existing local data

		mkdir repo.git && cd repo.git
		git init --bare

	_The remote repository has to be »bare« (does not contain a working filetree, but a special .git subdirectory only) in order to accept a push_

## Show local changes

* Current Status - Present branch name and changed files in working directory

		git status
		git st

	_requires an alias set for »st«_

* Changes to tracked files not yet staged

		git diff

* Show a summary of changes. A bit more than `git st`

		git diff --stat

* Difference between staged files and HEAD

		git diff --cached

* Difference between all files and HEAD since last commit

		git diff HEAD

* Show only filenames, e.g. to show all file differences between two branches

		git diff master --name-only
		git diff master --name-status

* Difference between branches, two commits, etc

		git diff <foo> <bar>

	_`+` line does exist in »bar« but not in »foo«, `-` reverse_

## Show history

* Show all commits, starting with newest

		git log

* Show history of changes with files changed

		git whatchanged

* Show changes over time for a specific file

		git log -p <file>

* Who changed what and when in a file

		git blame <file>

* Show a commit identified by its ID

		git show <ID>

* Show all commits with a certain word in commit message

		git log --grep=<searchword>

## Commit

* Add all (even untracked) changed files to next commit (≙ stage)

		git add -A

* Stage a tracked and modified file

		git add <file>

* Add some changes in a file to the next commit (partial commit)

		git add -p <file>

	`y` _Add this part to the next commit_
	`n` _Skip this part_
	`d` _Don’t add this and all remaining parts_
	`s` _Split the parts info smaller ones (only works if there’s unchanged lines between the changes in the displayed part)_
	`e` _Manually edit the parts_

* Commit all local changes in tracked files

		git commit -a

* Commit previously staged changes

		git commit
		git commit -m "<message>"

* Change the last commit

		git commit --amend -a

## Branches

* List local branches

		git branch

	_`*` marks the current branch_

* List remote-tracking branches

		git branch -r

	_use `-a` to show local and remote-tracking branches at once_

* Switch to a different branch

		git checkout <branch>
		git checkout -t <remote>/<remote-branch>

	_`-t` checkout a new branch based on remote branch and track it_

* Create a new branch based on your current HEAD

		git branch <new-branch>

	_use `git checkout -b <branch>` to create a branch and switch right into it_

* Create a new branch based on a remote branch and track it

		git branch --track <new-branch> <remote>/<remote-branch>

	_use `--no-track` to create a new branch based on a remote branch but don't track it_

* Set remote-tracking branch for current local branch

		git branch --set-upstream <local-branch> <remote>/<remote-branch>

* Delete a local branch

		git branch -d <branch>

* Delete a remote branch

		git push <remote> :<remote-branch>

## Tags

* Show all tags

		git tag -n

	_`-l` will show tag names only, `-n<num>` will add a number of lines from the annotation (default is one)_

* Mark the current commit with a tag

		git tag -m "<annotation>" <tag-name>

## Update

* Download all changes from <remote>, but don‘t merge them into HEAD

		git fetch <remote>

	_a manual merge is required now_

* Download changes and directly merge/ integrate into HEAD

		git pull [<remote> <branch>]

	_if the remote branch is tracked then `git pull` is sufficient_

* List all currently configured remote repositories

		git remote -v

* Show information about a remote, e.g. which branches exist in this remote

		git remote show <remote>

* Deletes all stale remote-tracking branches in a remote

		git remote prune <remote>

* Add a new remote repository

		git remote add <remote> <url>

## Publish

* Publish local changes in a branch to a remote repository

		git push [<remote> <branch>]
		git push --set-upstream <remote> <branch>

	_push branch to remote and track it, `-u` is the short option_

* Publish all local branches to a remote

		git push --all <remote>

* Publish a tag to a remote

		git push <remote> <tag>

* Publish your all tags

		git push --tags <remote>

## Merge

* View merge conflicts

		git merge <branch>

* Merge a branch into your current HEAD

		git merge <branch>

* Use a merge tool to solve conflicts

		git mergetool -t meld
		git mergetool

	_if empty this will use the configuration variable »merge.tool«_

* Use a recursive merge strategy

		git merge -s recursive -X <ours|theirs|patience>

	_»recursive« is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch, so it may be dropped_
	_»ours« will prefer current branch head over conflicting changes from the other tree but merge non-conflicts normally_
	_»patience« will cause GIT to spend some extra time while merging to avoid merge mistakes_

* Force merge to use current branch head and ignore all changes from other branches

		git merge -s ours

* Cancel merge

		git merge --abort

* Manually solve conflicts and mark file as resolved

		git add <resolved-file>
		git commit -m 'Manual Merge'

## Rebase

* Rebase your current HEAD onto <branch>

		git rebase <branch>
	_!! Don‘t rebase published commits!_

* Abort a rebase

		git rebase --abort

* Continue a rebase after resolving conflicts

		git rebase --continue

## Stash

* Stash all changes away

		git stash save [<annotation>]

* Show all available stashes

		git stash list

	_»stash@{0}« is the keyname of the stash, where 0 is the latest_

* Apply state from the stash list to the current working tree

		git stash apply [<stash-name>]

	_default is »stash@{0}«, use `git stash pop` to apply changes and remove the state from stash list_

* Remove a state from the stash list

		git stash drop [<stash-name>]

* Remove all the stashed states

		git stash clear

## Revert

* Remove files from stage (unadd)

		git reset HEAD
		git reset HEAD -- <single-file>

* Discard all local changes in your working directory

		git reset --hard HEAD

* Discard local changes in a specific file

		git checkout <file>

* Revert a commit

		git revert HEAD
		git revert <commit>

	_produces a commit (alters the history) with contrary changes to last commit_

* Remove a file from index but keep it on file system

		git rm --cached

## Configuration

* Get configuration option

		git config <section>.<key>

* Set configuration option

		git config --local <section>.<key> <value>

	_»local« will write to ».git/config« in current repository, »global« to »~/.gitconfig» and »system« to your systems »/etc/gitconfig«_

* Set username and e-mail

		git config --local user.name "<username>" && git config --local user.email <e-mail>

* Ignore mode changes (chmod)

		git config --local core.filemode false

* Set alias »st« for »status«

		git config --global alias.st status

## Commit Message Format

	[BUGFIX] Short summary

	Optional explanatory text. Separated by new line. Wrapped to 74 chars. Written in imperative present tense ("Fix bug", not "Fixed bug").

	Help others to understand what you did (Motivation for the change? Difference to previous version?), but keep it simple.

	Mandatory title prefix: [BUGFIX], [FEATURE] (also small additions) or [TASK] (none of the above, e.g. code cleanup). Additionall flags: [!!] (breaking change), [DB] (alter database definition), [CONF] (configuration change), [SECURITY] (fix a security issue).

	Bug tracker refs added at bottom (see http://is.gd/commit_refs).

	Resolve #42
	Ref #4 #8 #15 #16

_shortened, detailed example at http://is.gd/commit_format_

## Best practices

* Commit related changes
	* Each commit should adress one logical unit. Two different bugs should result into two commits.
* Commit early & often
	* Keep your commits small and comprehensible, split large features into logical chunks.
* Test code before committing
	* Make shure the code works, don't guess. Revert the commit if necessary.
* Don't commit half-done work
	* Commit only complete, logical changes, not half-done chunks. »Stash« changes if applicable.
* Don't commit hot files
	* Don't commit configuration files (commit a config template instead), personal data, temporary files (GIT is no backup system) or things that can be regenerated form other commited things.
* Write good commit messages
	* Help others to understand what you did (Motivation for the change? Whats the difference to the previous version?)
	* Useless commit messages may be forwarded to whatthecommit.com
* Write in imperative present tense («change», not «changed» or «changes»)
	* A commit is a set of instructions for how to go from a previous state to a new state, so you should describe was the commit does and not what it did to your repository.
* Don't panic
	* GIT lets you undo, fix or remove a bunch of actions
* Don't change published history
	* GIT allows you to rewrite public history, but it is problematic for everyone and thus it is just not best practice to do so.
* Use branches
	* Branching is cheap. Use separate branches for bugfixes, features & ideas. Make branching a part of ypur local workflow.
* Merge regularly
	* Don't merge a huge feature into the master, instead merge the master regularly with your branch.
* Use conventions
	* As with every development process: use conventions. For naming of branches and tags, how to write commit messages, when to commit into what branch, etc.
